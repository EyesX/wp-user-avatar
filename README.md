**WP User Avatar**

Download the plugin at: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-user-avatar/

**Description**

WordPress currently only allows you to use custom avatars that are uploaded through gravatar.com. WP User Avatar enables you to use any photo uploaded into your Media Library. This means any image you've uploaded for posts is available for you to use as an avatar. No extra folders or image editing functions are necessary.

To use WP User Avatar in your theme, manually replace get_avatar() with get_wp_user_avatar() or leave get_avatar() as-is. get_wp_user_avatar() has  functionality not available in get_avatar(). You can also use the shortcode [avatar] in your posts.

This plugin uses the new Media Uploader introduced in WordPress 3.5, but is also backwards-compatible to WordPress 3.0.
